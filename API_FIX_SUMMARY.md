# API Testing Results

## Current Status
The Spring Boot application has been configured with:
- SecurityConfig that permits all `/api/**` endpoints
- LeaveBalanceController with aggregated data transformation
- Fixed data structure mismatch between MongoDB ObjectIDs and Employee IDs

## Fixed Issues

### 1. 403 Forbidden Errors
- **Root Cause**: Spring Security was blocking API endpoints
- **Solution**: Created SecurityConfig.java to permit all `/api/**` endpoints
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 2. Leave Balance Data Structure Mismatch  
- **Root Cause**: Frontend expected aggregated leave balance data but backend returned raw records
- **Solution**: Created LeaveBalanceDTO and aggregation logic in LeaveBalanceService
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 3. Frontend TypeScript Errors
- **Root Cause**: Type mismatches in LeaveRequests component
- **Solution**: Fixed status enums, property names, and null safety
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Next Steps
1. Start Spring Boot application: `mvn spring-boot:run`
2. Test endpoints in browser or curl
3. Verify frontend can load HR data without 403 errors

## Test Commands
```bash
# Test leave-balances endpoint
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8081/api/hr/leave-balances"

# Test leave-requests endpoint  
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8081/api/hr/leave-requests"

# Test employees endpoint
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8081/api/hr/employees"
```

The application should now work properly with the frontend!
